## Hi there.

I'm not a programmer, at least not right now. I set this up to help work on [a book project](https://github.com/swaroopch/byte-of-vim).

I used to know [REXX](http://rexxinfo.org/) back in my OS/2 days, but that was a long time ago. Currently I'm dabbling in c and python, trying to learn them, so maybe I'll put this place to use eventually.

This page isn't nearly nerdy enough, so I'll come back soon and add some things.
